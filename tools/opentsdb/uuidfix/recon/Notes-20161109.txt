Error files break down as follows:
with 'ERROR [main]' / line=: 16501
   ^^^ these failed because of duplicate timestamps in export data
with 'ERROR [New I/O worker #2]' or 'ERROR [New I/O worker #3]' and RegionTooBusyException: 594
   ^^^ These failed because HBase was too busy (?)

For first set (16k files):
* grep 'line' info from error file (will need to extract timestamp and metric/tags for next step)
* read data file until metric we errored on.
* From next line, cat lines to new data file, but fix dupes in remaining data
* import new data file to tsdb
* If successful:
  - log happiness
  - rm new data file
  - mv old data / err files to success subfolder
* If unsuccessful:
  - log unhappiness
  - mv new data file, old data/err files to reprocess subfolder

For second set (594 files):
* Retry import (? check for dupes first ?)
* If success:
  - log happiness
  - mv out/err files to success subfolder (maybe separate from above)
* If not success:
  - log unhappiness
  - mv out/err files to reprocess subfolder (maybe separate from above)
