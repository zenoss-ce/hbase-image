Migrate process:
* validate params
* iterate metric names

move log config (logback.xml) to appropriate place

SCAN:
log 'scanning metricname to file'
tsdb scan ... --import metricname > file (with from config)
? watch stderr for problems ?
? gather data from stream as it goes to file ? - stats / guid list
stderr >> <logdir>/<metricname>.err
log 'done scanning metricname to file'
tsdb import ... file  (with to config)  to working dir

IMPORT
log importing metricname to db
tsdb import ...<filename>
MONITOR FOR ERRORS (on error, import will stop, but data up to error point has been imported)
(grep stderr for: ERROR)
ON ERROR:
    copy import file to reprocess location (and gzip)
    copy import stdout, stderr to reprocess location (and gzip)
    log error (log file and/or write metric name to reprocess file)

on success:
    log success
    clean up - remove data file, move stdout, stderr to archive location (and gzip)

==================

export fails when:
tsdb scan process returns nonzero
'ERROR' shows up in stderr
exception occurs during processing

import fails when:
tsdb import process returns nonzero
'ERROR' shows up in stderr
exception occurs during processing

after run, we want:
* list of metrics that were successful
* list of metrics that failed export
* list of metrics that failed import
* stderr for both of above
* data files (.gz) for failed imports (may need for reprocessing)
* no data files for successful metrics
? keep or delete stderr / log files for successful metrics


TO-DO:
- move logback.xml file before start
* add watchers to stderr for import/export
- move output files upon completion of metric
- clean up unwanted files
* test against opentsdb (incl moving tables to backup and attempting restore to new db
* compress output files
- fix logging?
* GUIDcheck for metrics w/GUIDS
